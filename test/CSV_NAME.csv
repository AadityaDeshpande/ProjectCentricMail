Have you noticed?

Every second day for the past 2 weeks I've released a new video.

There's some pretty cool stuff in there. Along with personal stories
of my own journey, I've got awesome interviews, research into what
makes successful people tick, along with some funny high production
value stuff.

I even hired out a whole bar for one of the videos, and had the staff
from the Lurn office act in it. It's not going to win an Emmy, but I
think you'll get a laugh :)

Below is a link to each of the videos. They're all pretty short, if
there's any you've missed, you should watch it now...

Struggling to budget and manage finances is common -- but talking honestly and openly about it isn't. Why do we hide our problems around money? In this thoughtful, personal talk, author Tammy Lally encourages us to break free of ""money shame"" and shows us how to stop equating our bank accounts with our self-worth.

Are you a life-giving leader, or taking life and grace from the people around you?

We have a responsibility to lead the people around us who trust us. And when life flows, influence grows. That’s what Tyler Reagin believes.

Tyler is the President of Catalyst, a Christian leadership development organization, and my guest on this week’s episode of the StartupCamp Show (https://startupcamp.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ede877f638f3cce6a0f0d5e0&amp;id=6e123607b4&amp;e=fccb25d0d6) . The subject of our conversation this week is what it means to lead with your truest self and be a life-giving leader.

In this conversation, you’ll also discover:
* A powerful reason to start believing in yourself
* What it means to sweat alongside your team
* Why you need to learn yourself before you can lead yourself

About this course

This course bridges the gap between introductory and advanced courses in Python.
While there are many excellent introductory Python courses available, most
typically do not go deep enough for you to apply your Python skills to research
projects. In this course, after first reviewing the basics of Python 3, we learn
about tools commonly used in research settings.

With a guided introduction and more independent in-depth exploration, you will
get to practice your new Python skills with various case studies chosen for
their scientific breadth and their coverage of different Python features.

What you'll learn

    Python 3 programming basics (a review)
    Python tools (e.g., NumPy and SciPy modules) for research applications
    How to apply Python research tools in practical settings

About this course

This course bridges the gap between introductory and advanced courses in Python.
While there are many excellent introductory Python courses available, most
typically do not go deep enough for you to apply your Python skills to research
projects. In this course, after first reviewing the basics of Python 3, we learn
about tools commonly used in research settings.

Business wise, I'm doing pretty well.

My company will do over $20 million this year, I have an amazing team
spread across half a dozen different countries, I've got an AMAZING
office... no... facility, which includes a 200 person lecture hall, 3
connected classrooms, offices, meeting rooms... etc.

But I hasn't been smooth sailing to get here!

Did you know, that by the time I reached 30 years old, I had build a
multi million dollar empire, lost it all, fell $1.7 million in debt,
paid back that debt, then built it all back up to an 8 figure
business!

I made a video of my journey, watch it now

And that was all before I hit 30!!

I don't want to toot my own horn, but can you imagine the things I
must have learned through these experiences?

What if you could just grab the key important lessons from all this,
and just download them to your brain. How powerful would that be!

Well... you can!

I've taken all of this information, all of the learning I've had
through building massive empires, losing it all, crushing debt, and
building again... I've distilled everything I know into my new book

Click the link below, and watch the video... whether you get the book
or not, that video is worth a watch. But more than that, get my new
book! It's free, you just have to cover a tiny shipping and handling!

Watch the video and get my new book now

If you've been a subscriber of mine for some time, you've probably
heard _""my story""..._

But not like this! [https://track.slsv2.com/track/click/cfHBhyLPMg/0e48f3c376310b267eafa8afc0c25fcd/a019e2671a5a572607589fe61d9ae3d1/inbox16

For those that don't know, in my early 20s, I was doing very well by
most people standards. I had a booming empire, I was on the cover of
_Inc_ magazine... things were rocking!

Then I started to make some bad decisions...

The next thing I knew, I was $1.7 million in debt. My health was
falling apart _(I was LITERALLY dying)_, my relationships were falling
apart... I started to drink... a LOT!

I was in a dark place!

Watch the video of my journey now
[https://track.slsv2.com/track/click/cfHBhyLPMg/0e48f3c376310b267eafa8afc0c25fcd/a019e2671a5a572607589fe61d9ae3d1/inbox16

Fast forward 18 months, and I managed to turn everything around. I
litterally went from $1.7 million in debt, to having an 8-figure
business, in just 18 months!

In the process, I discovered some universal truths.

In fact, I discovered a very specific 4 step process for succeeding as
an entrepreneur. I've since taught the principles to thousands of
students, and helped them create amazing businesses and amazing lives
for themselves.

Watch my journey, and discover the 4 step process now

Some advice is too good not to share.


Nearly every online business can be summed up in two words: Conversion Funnel.

A well-built conversion funnel turns visitors into customers, and customers into promoters. But if your funnel has problems—gaps, cracks, or odd angles—you are losing sales, wasting advertising dollars, and missing precious opportunities to help people fall in love with your brand. Your business will not survive online.

Because it’s so important, we decided to share some exclusive content with you today to help you fine-tune your conversion funnel.

In 5 Steps to a Sales-Boosting Conversion Funnel (https://startupcamp.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ede877f638f3cce6a0f0d5e0&amp;id=69e9132b42&amp;e=fccb25d0d6) , our founder Dale Partridge explains how to create an effective funnel for transforming visitors into customers and promoters, based on how he actually built StartupCamp.

Until now, this article (https://startupcamp.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6ede877f638f3cce6a0f0d5e0&amp;id=afd03c3a64&amp;e=fccb25d0d6)  has only been available to StartupCamp members, but today we’re taking down the paywall so we can give our friends and followers a hand on this mission-critical subject.
